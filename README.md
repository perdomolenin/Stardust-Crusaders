Stardust Crusaders is a side-scrolling web game created with the Unity3D Engine. It was published in the Unity Play online game store using the WebGL JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics in browsers. In the game, the player controls a spaceship as it tries to fly through a meteor shower. The player is controlled by pressing the spacebar to make the player move upwards. Gravity causes the spaceship to fall back down.

In order to continue flying, the player must avoid colliding with incoming asteroids which are spawned at random positions in the y-axis and move towards the player. The player can collect multiple powerups. Each powerup serves a different function such as destroying incoming asteroids or increasing the player's score.

All the code for the game was written with C# scripts. The game utilizes numerous Unity features such as particle effects, physics collisions, kinematics, game UIs, scene modeling, in-game triggers, sound FX, rigid-body simulation, and more. Currently the game supports various computer OS platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS and is played using any modern web-browser such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
